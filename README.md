The Oops Mini Project in C++ is a banking system application that allows users to perform various banking operations. It is designed using object-oriented programming principles and provides features such as checking account balance, cash withdrawal, displaying user details, and updating the mobile number.



1. Check Balance:
This feature enables users to check their account balance. Upon selecting this option, the program displays the current balance associated with the user's account.

2. Cash Withdrawal:
The cash withdrawal feature allows users to withdraw a specified amount from their account. Users are prompted to enter the withdrawal amount, and the program validates whether the requested amount is available in the account. If the withdrawal is successful, the program deducts the amount from the account balance.

3. Show User Details:
This feature provides users with the ability to view their account details. Upon selecting this option, the program displays the user's name, account number, address, and mobile number.

4. Update Mobile Number:
Users can update their mobile number using this feature. They are prompted to enter the new mobile number, and the program updates the mobile number associated with their account accordingly.
## Lessons Learned

The Oops Mini Project is implemented using C++ programming language and follows object-oriented principles to ensure code reusability and modularity. It utilizes classes and objects to represent various entities, such as users and accounts, and encapsulates data and functionality within these classes. The project demonstrates the use of class inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation to achieve the desired functionalities.


## Usage/Examples

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the source code files using a C++ compiler.
3. Run the compiled executable file to launch the banking   system application.



## Technologies Used

1. C++:
The primary programming language used for developing the project is C++. C++ is a powerful and versatile language that supports object-oriented programming, making it suitable for implementing complex systems like a banking application.

2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
The project extensively employs object-oriented programming principles. OOP allows for the creation of modular, reusable, and easy-to-maintain code by organizing data and behavior into objects, encapsulating data within classes, and establishing relationships between classes using concepts such as inheritance and polymorphism.

3. Integrated Development Environment (IDE):
An IDE of your choice, such as Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, or Xcode, can be used to write, compile, and debug the C++ code. IDEs provide a convenient development environment with features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and debugging tools, which facilitate the coding process.

4. Version Control:
Version control systems like Git can be used to track changes to the project's source code. Git enables collaboration, allows for branching and merging of code, and provides a reliable way to manage and document the project's development history.

5. Command Line Interface (CLI):
The project can be executed through a command line interface, where users interact with the application by inputting commands and receiving corresponding output. The CLI provides a straightforward and efficient way to navigate through the banking system and perform operations.
